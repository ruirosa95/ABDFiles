1. William Shakespeare, Sonnet 33.
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,
The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now

2. Thomas Dekker, ‘Golden Slumbers’.
Golden slumbers kiss your eyes,
Smiles awake you when you rise;
Sleep, pretty wantons, do not cry,
And I will sing a lullaby,
Rock them, rock them, lullaby

3. William Wordsworth, ‘My Heart Leaps Up’.
My heart leaps up when I behold
A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man
…
4. Lord Byron, ‘She Walks in Beauty’.
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies
…
5. W. B. Yeats, ‘He Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven’.
Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half light,
I would spread the cloths under your feet
…
6. Charlotte Mew, ‘A Quoi Bon Dire’.
Seventeen years ago you said
Something that sounded like Good-bye;
And everybody thinks that you are dead,
But I.
